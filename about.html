        <p>Hi, I’m Daniel — a former competitive junior golfer and now an NCAA cheerleader at the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>
        <p>I’ve been playing sports since I was a kid — everything from basketball to baseball to Taekwondo, where I earned a third-degree black belt and competed on the world stage. But it was golf that stole my focus in middle school. By 8th grade, I was fully committed, competing in Southern Texas PGA tournaments and dreaming of playing collegiate golf.</p>
        <p>As I improved, so did the expectations. Golf wasn’t just a game anymore — it became a measuring stick for my self-worth. A bad round didn’t just sting, it made me feel like <em>I</em> was the failure.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="below-image-text">
      <p>My moods, my confidence, and even my connection with my parents were tied to my performance. And when the recruiting process started, the pressure only got heavier. Every tournament felt like a tryout. Every mistake felt like a missed opportunity.</p>
      <p>Eventually, I was recruited to play NCAA Division III golf — but I made the choice to walk a different path. I stepped away from golf and found my way into college cheerleading, a sport that reconnected me with joy, team energy, and performance without fear. Ironically, as I let go of the pressure, my golf game improved — and I found peace with the sport I grew up loving.</p>
      <p>This course comes from that journey.</p>
      <p>It’s built for parents of athletes in any sport who want to better understand what their kids are going through. It’s for those moments when your child shuts down after a game, pushes you away, or spirals after a bad performance — and you’re left wondering how to help.</p>
      <p>This course isn’t about technique or coaching tips. It’s about emotional connection, communication, and becoming the trusted teammate your athlete needs — not just in their sport, but in life.</p>
      <p>Whether your child is chasing scholarships or just trying to find their confidence again, I’m here to help you build the kind of support system that truly makes a difference.</p>
      <p><strong>That’s what Course Companion is all about.</strong></p>

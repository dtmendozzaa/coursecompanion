  <section>
    <p>Hi, I’m Daniel—a former competitive junior golfer, now an NCAA Division II cheerleader at the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>
    <p>You might be wondering—<em>why is a cheerleader making a course about golf?</em><br>Let me tell you.</p>

    <p>I’ve been playing golf since I was three years old. Like a lot of kids, I grew up trying everything—basketball, baseball, flag football, soccer. I even became a third-degree black belt in ATA Taekwondo and competed on the world stage. But in 8th grade, I committed fully to golf.</p>

    <p>I started playing Southern Texas PGA junior tournaments and set my sights on college golf. Everything in my life revolved around one goal: compete at the collegiate level.</p>

    <p>As I got better, I started expecting more out of myself—and so did others. But when I didn’t play well, it didn’t just feel like a bad round. It felt like <strong>I</strong> was the failure.</p>

    <p>My mood, my self-worth, even my interactions with my family… they were all tied to my golf game. And when college recruiting started to feel real, the pressure grew even more. Tournaments that used to be fun suddenly felt like job interviews. Golf stopped being a game. It started feeling like a job.</p>

    <p>I’ll be honest—after a bad round, I was difficult to be around. I was frustrated, emotionally overwhelmed, and not open to hearing anything—even support.</p>

    <p>People would try to encourage me:<br>
    “It’s okay, you tried your best.”<br>
    “You’ll bounce back.”<br>
    Or worse, I’d get a lecture on what I did wrong.</p>

    <p>None of it helped. I didn’t need someone to fix my swing—I needed someone to understand my heart.<br>But I didn’t have the words to ask for that yet.</p>

    <p>Eventually, I was recruited to play NCAA Division III golf—but I decided to step away. Not because I didn’t love the game, but because I needed to heal my relationship with it.</p>

    <p>Today, I still play golf—but now, I play pressure-free. I enjoy going to the range again. I love playing with my friends. And ironically, <strong>my golf game is the best it’s ever been.</strong></p>

    <p>Golf is back to being something I do because I love it—not because I need to prove something.</p>

    <p>I built this course because I know what it’s like to feel emotionally overwhelmed by the game. I know what it’s like for parents to want to help—but accidentally say the wrong thing.</p>

    <p>And I know how powerful it can be when the people closest to you know how to show up <strong>calmly, compassionately, and clearly</strong>.</p>

    <p>This course isn’t about mechanics—it’s about communication, emotional safety, and <strong>rebuilding the relationship between a parent and their competitive athlete</strong>.</p>

    <p>Whether your child plays college golf or not, I want to help you become someone they can trust—not just in golf, but in life.<br>
    <strong>You get to take your relationship back.<br>
    That’s what Course Companion is all about.</strong></p>
